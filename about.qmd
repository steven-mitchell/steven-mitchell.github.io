## Then

<p class=".title">

I spent 8 years working as a wildlife biologist. I worked for the Forest Service - Region 5, Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks, and Turnstone Environmental Consultants. I worked to monitor carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevadas, consult on ESA section 7 surveys for threatened and endangered bird species, mitigate human-wildlife conflict, and research zoonotic diseases.

## Now

<p class=".title">

In June 2025, I'm wrapping up my Master's of Environmental Science & Management at UCSB's Bren School. I've focused on technical training in data science, statistics, conservation planning, and environmental policy.

</p>

## Soon

<p>I aim to work in the non-profit or public sectors applying quantitative techniques to environmental problem solving.</p>

## What I do for fun

<p class=".orange-text">

I backcountry ski, mountaineer, backpack, bike-pack, white-water paddle board, and generally get into stupid situations.

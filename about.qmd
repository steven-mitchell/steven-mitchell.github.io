<p class=".title">

I spent 8 years working as a wildlife biologist. I worked for the Forest Service - Region 5, Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks, Turnstone Environmental Consultants, and the National Wildlife Research Center. I worked to monitor carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevadas, consult on ESA section 7 surveys for threatened and endangered bird species, mitigate human-wildlife conflict, and research zoonotic diseases.

In June 2025, I'm wrapping up my Master's at UCSB's <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management </a>. I've focused on technical training in geospatial analysis, conservation planning, data science, and environmental policy.

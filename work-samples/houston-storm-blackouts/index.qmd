## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated

-   Manipulating raster data

### Maps Interpretation

Note the change in the urban center. The general pattern of blackouts are visible in the form of orange encroaching into the yellow area. This is apparent despite the overall increase in light intensity across the area.

# Part 2: Identifying impacted homes and census tracts based on changes in night light intensity.

## Homes impacted by blackout

```{r}

## Figure Interpretation

Above are depicted wide spread of incomes impacted by the blackouts. Note that lower median household incomes are more highly represented than un-impacted tracts.

# Discussion

In the above analysis and accompanying figures, the impacts of the storm are made apparent as a visible change in night light intensity in the hoston metro area. An estimated **81914 homes experienced blackouts** according to this analysis. Further, these results suggest that blackouts occured independently of income level, as indicated by the median household incomes across census blocks. This is somewhat surprising as one might expect households with higher income to overcome barriers and power their homes (and lights). This trend implies the pervasive nature of the blackouts without readily available alternate power sources.

# Acknowledgements

This analysis and workflow was originally created by Dr. Ruth Oliver of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management for the Masters of Environmental Data Science course, Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing. My initial work through of this analysis was conducted as part of a homework assignment for this class, and I later polished up this repository.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is too large to be hosted on GitHub. Instead, download the data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bTk62xwOzBqWmmT791SbYbHxnCdjmBtw/view?usp=drive_link"> here </a> as a zipped folder, unzip, and move into the R project manually.

# About Me

I'm a wildlife biologist, snowboarder, and data nerd. For over ten years, I've tracked carnivores through the mountains, wrangled mountain goats, ran spotted owl monitoring projects, hazed elk, and caught roosts full of bats for disease research.

In June 2025, I wrapped up my Master's at UCSB's <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management </a>, which helped me land my dream job with NPS. Unfortunately, I immediately got DOGE'd, and now I'm looking to start my next chapter in the Seattle area.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-mitchell-94b664208/"> So, if you are looking at this page, you should hire me! </a>

# About Me

I've worked as a wildlife biologist for over six years and in the environmental field, more generally, for over ten years. I worked to monitor carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevadas, consult on ESA section 7 surveys for threatened and endangered species, write **NEPA** documents, manage human-wildlife conflict, and research zoonotic diseases.

Most of my experience has been in some sort of leadership role, whether that was leading field crews, managing projects, or hiring and training junior biologists. I have a strong background in wildlife capture and handling, including chemical immobilization, zoonotic disease research, and physiological studies. I have experience with a variety of species, including bats, birds, ungulates, and mesocarnivores. I've also worked a million other jobs between wildlife projects like brewing craft beer as a certified cicerone, machining fighter jet components, trimming trees as an urban arborist, and bartending at ski resorts to enable my snowboarding habit. 

I went to grad school to move from fulfilling, yet unstable seasonal work to a more consistent career in conservation planning and environmental management. In June 2025, I wrapped up my Master's at UCSB's <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management </a>. I've focused on technical training in geospatial analysis, conservation planning, data science, and environmental policy.

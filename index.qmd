# About Me

I've worked as a wildlife biologist for over six years wrangling mountain goats, following spotted owls to their nests, hazing elk, tracking Pacific fishers, and catching roosts full of bats.

I went to grad school to move from adventurous and fulfilling, yet unstable seasonal work to a more consistent career in conservation planning and environmental management. In June 2025, I wrapped up my Master's at UCSB's <a href="https://bren.ucsb.edu/"> Bren School of Environmental Science & Management </a>. There, I built out my toolkit with training in GIS, data science, environmental law and policy, and conservation planning. For my project, I worked for the Nature Conservancy to develop an online toolkit for climate adaptation in western dry forests.

<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-mitchell-94b664208/"> Now that I've graduated, I'm looking for my next opportunity. So, if you are looking at this page, you should hire me! </a>

title: "Work Samples"
---

Soon, this page will contain a blog-formatted gallery of selected work samples from my portfolio of projects.

Some examples are: 

- A technical report wherein I develop Maxent species distribution models for migratory tree-roosting bat species in Washington State, map wind energy site suitability, and spatially compare the two to identify areas for new wind energy development that minimizes bat mortality. 
- A Shiny app that explores nationwide data of bird captures at MAPS banding stations, with an associated population model that predicts species abundances based on mark-recapture data. 
- R Quarto documents of various geospatial analyses run in R with associated maps. 
- R Quarto documents of various population models I've run in R. 
- Results and maps of various habitat connectivity models such as Circuitscape. 
- And likely more such things related to Planetary Health.

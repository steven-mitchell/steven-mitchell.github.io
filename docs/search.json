    "text": "Hi, I’m Steven! I graduated from Humboldt State University in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science in Wildlife specializing in Conservation Biology and Applied Vertebrate Ecology. During my undergrad, I worked for the Forest Service monitoring carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevada mountains and studying bat ecology on the Redwood Coast. After graduation, I went on to work as a wildlife biologist for eight years. I worked as an environmental consultant in the Pacific Northwest’s timber lands, where I surveyed for threatened and endangered species. I then joined the National Park Service, where I captured and removed invasive mountain goats from the Olympic Peninsula, monitored the spread of white-nose syndrome in bat colonies, and managed Northern Spotted Owl projects. In my time as a wildlife biologist, I became passionate about improving the laws and policies governing natural resources. At the Bren School, I’m specializing in Environmental Policy and Conservation Planning with a focus on Strategic Communication."

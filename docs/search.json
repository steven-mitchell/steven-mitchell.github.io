    "text": "About Me\nI have worked as a wildlife biologist for over six years. I worked for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station, Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks, Turnstone Environmental Consultants, and the National Wildlife Research Center. I worked to monitor carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevadas, consult on ESA section 7 surveys for threatened and endangered species, ensure regulatory compliance (NEPA) for transportation projects, mitigate human-wildlife conflict, and research zoonotic diseases.\nMost of my experience has been in some sort of leadership role, whether that was leading field crews, managing projects, or hiring and training junior biologists. I have a strong background in wildlife capture and handling, including chemical immobilization, zoonotic disease research, and physiological studies. I have experience with a variety of species, including bats, birds, ungulates, and mesocarnivores. I’ve also worked a million other jobs between wildlife projects like brewing craft beer as a certified cicerone, machining fighter jet components, trimming trees as an urban arborist, and bartending at ski resorts to enable my snowboarding habit.\nI went to grad school to move from fulfilling, yet unstable seasonal work to a more consistent career in conservation planning and environmental management. In June 2025, I wrapped up my Master’s at UCSB’s  Bren School of Environmental Science & Management . I’ve focused on technical training in geospatial analysis, conservation planning, data science, and environmental policy.\n\nSo, if you are looking at this page, you should  hire me! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFieldwork at Mt Rainier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA barred owl (Strix varia) that found herself caught in my mist net one morning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy best friend, Piko (Felis catus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little brown bat (Myotis lucifigus) captured for white-nose syndrome surveillance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) caught at a MAPS station at Mt Rainier.

Photo credit: Google Creative Commons\n\n\n\nAbstract\nIn this report, we investigate the impacts to crop production from an infectious fungal disease affecting bats. The fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans causes white-nose syndrome in hibernating bats and has spread across the United States. Declining bat populations are expected to have substantial impacts on the environment, specifically agriculture. Bats eat insects that damage crops and the consumption of these insects by bats saves farmers billions of dollars in pest control services annually. We map white-nose syndrome occurrence and pesticide use by county across the US. The white-nose syndrome data from USGS is a time series of categorical presence/absence data of the disease and fungus. The pesticide use data is a time series of continuous concentration data by US counties. We run a linear regression to quantify the relationship between white-nose syndrome detection and pesticide use. We suggest next steps move towards incorporating public health data and running a multivariate analysis between WNS status, pesticide use, and negative health outcomes.\n\n\nBackground\nWhite-nose syndrome (WNS) is a disease caused by the invasive European fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd). Pd and WNS were first detected in the U.S. in 2007.WNS has killed off over 90% of the total populations of at least 3 species (Myotis septentrionalis, Myotis lucifugus, and Perimyotis subflavus) and heavily impacted others (Quarles 2013, NPS 2019). Pd grows on the walls of caves, and can be spread between caves by both bats and human activity.\nAt the population scale, bats serve as natural pest control by eating insects that would otherwise feed on crops. Bats are vital to agricultural ecosystems, saving the U.S. farming industry an estimated $3.7 billion annually in pest control costs (Frank 2024). Their decline has led to increased reliance on chemical pesticides, specifically insecticides, which can have unintended consequences for environmental and human health. Pesticide exposure has been linked to adverse health effects, including respiratory issues, neurological disorders, infant mortality, and cancer (Brainerd 2014, Dias 2023). Additionally, declining bat populations may contribute to ecosystem imbalances, increasing the risk of pest outbreaks and crop failures.\nKey drivers of this issue include fungal disease transmission. WNS spreads rapidly in hibernating bat colonies, which causes mass mortality events. Habitat loss and climate change also are a key driver to this problem. Environmental stressors exacerbate disease impacts and loss of habitat further limits bat population recovery. Lastly, agricultural intensification further exacerbates the problem. Reduced bat populations lead to greater pesticide dependence, increasing exposure risks for both humans and wildlife.\nTo address this issuse we pose the following research question: Does pesticide use increase following detection of Pd or WNS?\n\n\nMethods\nTo investigate the relationship between White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) in bats and pesticide use in agriculture, we compiled and processed datasets from the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS; Wieben 2021). WNS occurrence data was obtained at the county level, categorizing locations based on the presence of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) and confirmed WNS cases (USGS 2024). Pesticide use data, available as continuous concentration estimates, was aggregated by county and standardized by land area to facilitate comparisons. These datasets were integrated with U.S. county shapefiles to ensure spatial consistency for mapping and analysis.\nData visualization played a key role in our analysis. We created a bivariate map to identify regions where both factors co-occur. This map provided a clear spatial representation of potential associations between WNS prevalence and increased pesticide application. To quantify this relationship, we conducted a linear regression analysis, treating WNS status as the independent variable and pesticide use per square meter as the dependent variable. This allowed us to assess whether counties with higher WNS detections also exhibited increased pesticide use.\nThrough this methodological approach, we aimed to provide a comprehensive assessment of the link between WNS-related bat population declines, increased pesticide reliance, and potential consequences for both agriculture and public health. We provide potential solutions to combat this planetary health problem and suggest next steps for future research.\n\n\nResults\n\nData Exploration\n\n\nCode\n#Load libraries\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(tmap)\nlibrary(viridisLite)\nlibrary(biscale)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(janitor)\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(biscale)\nlibrary(ggspatial)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(cowplot)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Global Map Options\n# US state boundary data for use as a bounding box\nus &lt;- read_sf(here(\"data\", \"tl_2024_state\", \"tl_2024_us_state.shp\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(!STUSPS %in% c(\"MP\", \"GU\", \"AS\", \"AK\", \"HI\", \"PR\", \"VI\"))\n\n# make a bounding box\nbbox &lt;- st_bbox(us)\n\n# load US counties shapefile\ncounties &lt;- read_sf(here(\"data\", \"tl_2023_us_county\", \"tl_2023_us_county.shp\")) %&gt;% \n  mutate(county = NAME)\n\n\n\nWhite-Nose Syndrome and Pseudomycan destructans Detections by County\nFigure 1 shows the presence of Pd and WNS by county.

Associations of WNS and high pesticide use are concentrated in midwestern counties. This map was made by  Madison Calbert  in ArcGIS Pro\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nRecommendations\nOur research sought to determine whether pesticide use increases following the detection of Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd) or white-nose syndrome (WNS) in bats. Our findings suggest that this is the case. As bat populations decline due to WNS, farmers may rely more heavily on chemical pest control methods to compensate for the loss of bats as natural insect predators. This pattern highlights the ecological and economic importance of bats in agricultural systems and raises concerns about the broader environmental and human health consequences of increased pesticide use.\nThe implications of these findings extend beyond agriculture. Pesticide exposure has been linked to respiratory issues, neurological disorders, and cancer, posing risks to both farmworkers and surrounding communities (Brainerd 2014, Diaz 2023, Frank 2024). Additionally, excessive pesticide application can disrupt ecosystems by harming non-target species, contaminating water sources, and contributing to insecticide resistance in pest populations. Given these risks, conservation strategies that protect bat populations may offer an alternative to increasing pesticide dependence.\nPotential solutions to combat this planetary health problem include:\n\nProtect Bat Habitat:\n\nConserve Pd-negative caves and surrounding habitats to sustain healthy bat populations.\nModify or construct man-made structures to provide Pd-free bat habitats.\n\nPrevent the Spread of Pd:\n\nRestrict human access to caves to reduce the risk of Pd transmission.\nInvestigate treatments to inoculate caves against Pd, though current methods remain limited in efficacy.\n\nPrevent the Onset of WNS in Bats:\n\nDevelop and implement vaccination programs to protect bats from WNS, though these are still experimental.\n\n\n\n\nLimitations & Next Steps\nWhile our analysis identifies a correlation between WNS presence and higher pesticide use, several limitations must be considered. First, correlation does not imply causation, and other factors such as changing pest populations, shifts in land use, or regional policy differences may also influence pesticide application. Second, our reliance on county-level data may obscure finer-scale patterns, and inconsistencies in pesticide reporting across states could introduce variability in our dataset. Additionally, the potential lag between WNS detection and pesticide use increases is not fully accounted for in this analysis. A longer-term study would be necessary to assess delayed effects more accurately.\nTo build on this research, future studies should incorporate public health data to explore potential links between WNS status, pesticide use, and human health outcomes. A multivariate analysis could provide a clearer understanding of these interactions, informing conservation and agricultural policies that support both ecosystem health and public well-being. We suggest moving towards incorporating public health data and running a multivariate analysis between WNS status, pesticide use, and negative health outcomes. We attempted to incorporate public health data on infant mortality but were hindered by data availability as shown in Figure 5.

In Washington, hydroelectric power represents roughly 60% of statewide electricity production, with natural gas at 18%, wind energy at 8%, nuclear energy at 8%, coal plants at 4%, and the remaining 2% consisting of a variety of other sources including solar energy\\(^6\\). Across the state of Washington, 1,823 wind turbines have already been installed\\(^5\\).

    "text": "2.1 Species Distribution Models for Each Species\nI followed the methods used by Huang et al 2024 to build habitat suitability models for hoary bats and silver-haired bats\\(^8\\). I applied the habitat suitability model Maxent within the R package Wallace to create seasonal habitat suitability maps for hoary bats and silver-haired bats. I downloaded the WorldClim2 environmental data set and used variables identified as important to these bat species’ ecologies in Huang et al. 2024 and Weller and Baldwin 2012: temperature, vapor pressure, solar radiation, precipitation, and wind speed\\(^{8-10}\\). The Maxent species distribution model is dependent on large quantities of high-quality occurrence data. For this purpose, I used occurrence data from acoustic monitoring coordinated by the North American Bat Monitoring Program (NABat)\\(^4\\). This database consists of results from continent-wide, systematic surveys conducted by trained biologists with state-of-the-art equipment\\(^4\\). As such, it represents the largest database of its kind and houses data with the highest possible confidence in species identification derived from consistent survey effort\\(^4\\). Because these species are migratory and their energetic needs vary seasonally, I temporally sliced the climate data to conduct a separate SDM for each three-month season\\(^{3,8,10}\\). I ran Maxent for each species for each season for a total of 8 SDMs. I ran all SDMs with various combinations of parameters until I identified the settings that yielded the highest area-under-the-curve (AUC) scores.\nThis combination of settings was:\n\nSpatially partition the occurrence data by Wallace’s checkerboard 2 function\nSelect the linear, hinge, and quadratic feature classes\nSet the regularization multiplier to 0.5\nDo not use clamping or parallel processing\n\n\n2.1.1 Occurrence Data\nThe NABat occurrence data was formatted as rows of individual detections and contained three variables relevant to my objectives: Date/time, location geometry, and species ID. The location geometry was provided in Well-Known Binary (WKB), which needed to be converted into latitude and longitude for compatibility with Wallace.\n\n\n2.1.2 Climate Data\nI downloaded climate data from the WorldClim2 database based on 5 of the 6 variables relevant to the ecology of the two bat species: air temperature, solar radiation, wind speed, precipitation, and vapor pressure\\(^{3,8,10}\\). Moon phase is also known to be an important indicator of bat occurrences, but because it is meaningless when formatted as a seasonal average, I excluded it from this analysis\\(^{10}\\). The data was provided as monthly averages, and I aggregated it into 3-month seasonal averages for Spring (February – April), Summer (May – July), Fall (August – October), and Winter (November – January)."

These criteria are slope, wind energy potential, land use, population density, distance to transmission lines, and distance to roads. In further accordance with the methods of Miller and Li 2014, I excluded certain areas as categorically unsuitable for wind energy development\\(^{11}\\). These excluded areas are 1600 meters around urban areas, 1600 meters around airports, 100 meters around roads, 100 meters around railroads, wetlands, and protected conservation areas\\(^{11}\\). I downloaded these data from the US census, US Geological Survey (USGS), and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)\\(^{12-14}\\). I calculated wind energy site suitability ratings according to the multi-criteria rating scheme developed in Miller and Li 2014 shown in Table 1\\(^{11}\\). I calculated suitability scores based on a weighted mean of the input rasters according to the values in Table 2, derived from the methods of Miller and Li 2014 and used by Huang et al 2024\\(^{8,11,15,16}\\).

The data was provided as a time series of wind speeds recorded at 30-minute intervals, and I aggregated it into a shapefile of location points with their associated annual averages wind speeds. I then joined this data into a blank raster template of Washington State, resulting in a raster of annual average wind speeds. I then reclassified the wind speed data into categories of suitability from 0-4 based on the values in Table 1\\(^{11}\\).\n\n\n2.2.2 Slope Data\nI derived slope data from USGS Digital Elevation Model (DEM) data downloaded from the USGS and then reclassified it into suitability scores from 0-4 based on the values in Table 1\\(^{11}\\).\n\n\n2.2.3 Land Cover Data\nI downloaded land cover data from the National Land Cover Database and reclassified it into categories of suitability from 0-4 as shown in Table 1\\(^{11}\\).\n\n\n2.2.4 Population Density Data\nI downloaded census tract data from the US Census Bureau TIGER/Lines database\\(^{12}\\). The data was provided as vector polygons of census blocks with columns for land area and total population. I divided the population columns by the land area column and joined the resulting population per square kilometer column back onto the census block polygons.

I then reclassified the population densities into categories of wind energy site suitability based on the values in Table 1\\(^{11}\\).\n\n\n2.2.5 Distance to Transmission Lines Data\nI downloaded transmission line vector data from the US Census TIGER/Lines database\\(^{12}\\). The data was provided as polylines vector data representing major components of the US energy grid including major transmission lines. I generated a blank raster as a template of Washington State, vectorized it into a grid, and generated centroids for each grid cell as a shapefile of individual points. I then calculated the distance from each centroid point to the nearest transmission line, joined these distances onto the grid of centroid points, and rasterized the grid based on the extent, cell sizes, and projection of my original blank raster template. I then reclassified the resulting raster into suitability scores from 0-4 based on the values in Table 1\\(^{11}\\).\n\n\n2.2.6 Distance to Major Roads Data\nI downloaded major road vector data from the US Census TIGER/Lines database\\(^{12}\\). The data was provided as polylines vector data representing primary and secondary roads and highways. I generated a blank raster as a template of Washington State, vectorized it into a grid, and generated centroids for each grid cell as a shapefile of individual points. I then calculated the distance from each centroid point to the nearest major road, joined these distances onto the grid of centroid points, and rasterized the grid based on the extent, cell sizes, and projection of my original blank raster template. I then reclassified the resulting raster into suitability scores from 0-4 based on the values in Table 1\\(^{11}\\)."

To assess and map the spatial relationship between wind energy site suitability and tree-roosting bat distributions, I reclassified the SDM rasters into equal bins of suitability at 0.25 increments to mirror the 0-4 wind energy site suitability format. Because wind energy development is a near-permanent change to the landscape, my SDMs are seasonal, and wind energy site suitability is based on annual averages, I aggregated all 8 SDMs (4 seasons by 2 species) by selecting the maximum suitability score for each raster cell across all SDMs. I then subtracted this overall SDM raster from the wind energy site suitability raster to generate a map of bat-avoidant wind energy site suitability ranked on the same 0-4 scale."

Further, the results of these SDMs should be ground-truthed with additional bioacoustic monitoring, emphasizing collection of supplementary winter data. Existing turbine locations should be investigated for variations in bat mortality rates to determine if these bat-avoidant scores correspond to differences in mortality rates across turbines. With sufficient data, there would be great value in assessing the impact of these mortality dynamics on the overall population trends of both species. The analysis should also be expanded to the full continental U.S. and incorporate an additional species, Mexican free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis mexicana)\\(^8\\). Mexican free-tailed bats represent a significant portion of nationwide bat mortality, but the species was not included here because these bats are not common in Washington State\\(^8\\)."

Together, these points indicate that the most vulnerable people (low income) experience the most air quality risk (PM 2.5 exposure) and the lowest life expectancy compared to other parts of Los Angeles County. The impacts of Redlining are lethal."

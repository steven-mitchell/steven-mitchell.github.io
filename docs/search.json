Please have a look at my portfolio of projects, my resume, and some of my wildlife photography.

I worked for the Forest Service’s Pacific Southwest Research Station, Olympic and Mount Rainier National Parks, Turnstone Environmental Consultants, and the National Wildlife Research Center. I worked to monitor carnivore populations in the Sierra Nevadas, consult on ESA section 7 surveys for threatened and endangered species, ensure regulatory compliance (NEPA) for transportation projects, mitigate human-wildlife conflict, and research zoonotic diseases.\nMost of my experience has been in some sort of leadership role, whether that was leading field crews, managing projects, or hiring and training junior biologists. I have a strong background in wildlife capture and handling, including chemical immobilization, zoonotic disease research, and physiological studies. I have experience with a variety of species, including bats, birds, ungulates, and mesocarnivores. I’ve also worked a million jobs from brewing craft beer as a certified cicerone to machining fighter jet components to trimming trees as an urban arborist.\nIn June 2025, I’m wrapping up my Master’s at UCSB’s  Bren School of Environmental Science & Management . I’ve focused on technical training in geospatial analysis, conservation planning, data science, and environmental policy.\n\n Hire me! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFieldwork at Mt Rainier\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA barred owl (Strix varia) that found herself caught in my mist net one morning\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy best friend, Piko (Felis catus)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA little brown bat (Myotis lucifigus) captured for white-nose syndrome surveillance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA rufous hummingbird (Selasphorus rufus) caught at a MAPS station at Mt Rainier.

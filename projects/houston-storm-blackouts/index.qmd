# merge the 02-16 light rasters

## Maps of Houston nightlight intensity before and after the storm.

```{r}
#crop the night light data to the Houston area
h_light_0207 <- terra::crop(light_02_07, bbox)
summary(h_light_0207)

h_light_0216 <- terra::crop(light_02_16, bbox)

  tm_raster(breaks = c(0, 0.2, 1, 3, 5, 10, 100, 200, 10000, 100000),

### Maps Interpretation

Note the change in the urban center. The general pattern of blackouts are visible in the form of orange encroaching into the yellow area. This is apparent despite the overall increase in light intensity across the area.

```{r}
# use h_light_0207 to make a Houston area vector for later use
houston <- st_as_stars(h_light_0207)

# vectorize
houston <- st_as_sf(houston)

# check / convert Houston cookie cutter data CRS

if(crs(houston) == "EPSG: 3083"){
  print("CRS correct")
} else{
  warning("Updated CRS to EPSG 3083")
  houston <- st_transform(houston, "EPSG: 3083")
}

# dissolve the grid into cookie cutter
houston <- st_union(houston)

# Calculate light intensity difference
light_diff <- light_02_07 - light_02_16
summary(light_diff)

# Calculate light intensity difference

## define reclass matrix
rcl <- matrix(c(-20900, -200, 1,# group 1 ranges from -20900 (min) to -200
                -201, 3775, NA), # group 2 ranges from -200 to 3776 (max)
                ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)

# use reclass matrix to reclassify light_diff raster
blackouts <- classify(light_diff, rcl = rcl)

# change reclasssed values into factors
values(blackouts) <- as.factor(values(blackouts))
summary(blackouts)

# Crop blackout raster to Houston area
blackouts_cropped <- terra::crop(blackouts, bbox)
summary(blackouts_cropped)


# Vectorize light raster
## first, convert it to a stars object
blackouts_stars <- st_as_stars(blackouts_cropped)

# have a look at it
summary(blackouts_stars)

# vectorize!!!
blackouts_vector <- st_as_sf(blackouts_stars)

# check / convert blackout vector CRS
if(crs(blackouts_vector) == "EPSG: 3083"){
  print("CRS correct")
} else{
  warning("Updated CRS to EPSG 3083")
  blackouts_vector <-  st_transform(blackouts_vector, "EPSG: 3083")
}
```

# Part 2: Identifying impacted homes based on changes in night light intensity.

```{r}
# Make a 200 m buffer around roads
## check for meters as units
st_crs(osm_roads)$units 

# buffer the roads by 200m
highway_buffer <- st_buffer(osm_roads, dist = 200)

# combine th buffer polygons
highway_buffer_union <- st_union(highway_buffer)

## Exclude highway buffer from blackout mask
blackouts_mask_no_highways <- st_difference(blackouts_vector, highway_buffer_union)

# Spatial geometry filtering to count homes impacted by blackouts
blackout_homes <-  st_filter(x = osm_buildings, y = blackouts_mask_no_highways, .predicate = st_intersects)
```

## Map of Homes Impacted by Blackouts

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

map_blackout_homes <- tm_basemap("Esri")+
  tm_shape(blackout_homes)+
  tm_polygons(col = "black")

tmap_save(map_blackout_homes, here("outputs", "map_blackout_homes.jpg"))
```

![](outputs\map_blackout_homes.jpg){height="600" width="800"}

Homes likely to have experienced the blackout are depicted as gray polygons in the above figure. An estimated **81914 homes experienced blackouts**.

# Part 3: Identifying the census tracts impacted by blackout.

```{r}
## Crop census data to the Houston area
census_income <- st_filter(x = census_income, y = houston,
                           .predicate = st_intersects)

# filter down to the affected tracts
blackout_tracts <- st_filter(x = census_income, y = blackouts_mask_no_highways,
                             .predicate = st_intersects)

# filter down to the unaffected tracts 
## (st_difference isn't working so this is my work-around)

# find the indices of blackout polygons
blackout_indices <- st_intersects(census_income, blackouts_mask_no_highways)

# filter by those indices
unaffected_tracts <- census_income[!sapply(blackout_indices, length) > 0, ]
```

## Map of Blackouts by Census Tract

```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")

map_blackouts_tracts <- tm_basemap("Esri")+
  tm_shape(blackout_tracts)+
  tm_polygons(col = "darkred",
              alpha = 0.5,
              title = "Blackouts")

tmap_save(map_blackouts_tracts, here("outputs", "map_blackouts_tracts.jpg"))
```

![](outputs\map_blackouts_tracts.jpg){height="600" width="800"}

### Map Interpretation

Here the census tracts likely to have experienced the blackout are visible as red polygons overlaid on the Houston area.

# Part 4: Comparing the median household income among impacted and un-impacted census tracts.

```{r}
plot_blackout_income <- ggplot(data = blackout_tracts, aes(x = B19013e1))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(x = "Median Household Income ($)",
       y = "",
       title = "Distribution of Median Incomes for Census Tracts Impacted by Blackouts")+
  theme_bw()

plot_unaffected_income <- ggplot(data = unaffected_tracts, aes(x = B19013e1))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(x = "Median Household Income ($)",
       y = "",
       title = "Distribution of Median Incomes for Census Tracts Un-impacted by Blackouts")+
  theme_bw()

ggsave(here("outputs", "plot_unaffected_income.png"), plot_unaffected_income)

ggsave(here("outputs", "plot_blackout_income.png"), plot_blackout_income)
```

::: {layout="[[1,1]]"}

![](outputs\plot_unaffected_income.png)

## Figure Interpretation

Above are depicted wide spread of incomes impacted by the blackouts. Note that lower median household incomes are more highly represented than un-impacted tracts.

# Discussion

In the above analysis and accompanying figures, the impacts of the storm are made apparent as a visible change in night light intensity in the Houston metro area. An estimated **81914 homes experienced blackouts** according to this analysis. Further, these results suggest that blackouts occured independently of income level, as indicated by the median household incomes across census blocks. This is somewhat surprising as one might expect households with higher income to overcome barriers and power their homes (and lights). This trend implies the pervasive nature of the blackouts without readily available alternate power sources.

# Acknowledgements

This analysis and workflow was originally created by Dr. Ruth Oliver of the Bren School of Environmental Science & Management for the Masters of Environmental Data Science course, Geospatial Analysis and Remote Sensing. My initial work through of this analysis was conducted as part of a homework assignment for this class, and I later polished up this repository.

## Data

The data used in this analysis is too large to be hosted on GitHub. Instead, download the data <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bTk62xwOzBqWmmT791SbYbHxnCdjmBtw/view?usp=drive_link"> here </a> as a zipped folder, unzip, and move into the R project manually.
